            <p>Color therapy, also known as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromotherapy" target = "_blank">chromotherapy</a>, is an alternative treatment that uses colors and light to promote healing and enhance mental and emotional well-being. It is based on the belief that different colors can have a positive influence on the body and mind. For example, warm colors like red and orange are thought to energize and stimulate the body, while cool colors like blue and green are believed to calm the mind and relieve stress. Color therapy is often used in a variety of settings, from wellness centers to private therapy sessions, where it is combined with other techniques to aid in relaxation, reduce anxiety, and even address physical ailments. The practice is rooted in the idea that color has a profound impact on our psychological state, and using the right colors can help restore balance and improve overall health.</p>

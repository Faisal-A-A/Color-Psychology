            <p>Do you feel energized when you see red? Does the color blue make you feel calm and relaxed? Artists and interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions."Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions," the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked.</p>
            <p>Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with physiological changes, including increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">"It's amazing how colors can truly impact our mood and influence our behavior,"</span> - Rachel Goldman PhD.</p>
            <p>"Take a moment to think about a familiar space to you, is there a color that stands out about that space? Think about your clothes and how different colored clothing makes you feel when you wear them. Perhaps the next time you are feeling kind of blah, think about this and see if your mood shifts by wearing a different color. Many times, it's the small things that can have the largest impact."</p>
